# this file has the low-level libogg types and wrappers for ccall functions. It
# provides some thin convenience wrappers but matches the same basic API as

# When the libogg function modifies a variable by reference, the wrapper will

    ogg_sync_buffer(dec::OggSyncState, size)

Request a buffer for writing new raw data into from the physical bitstream.

Buffer space which has already been returned is cleared, and the buffer is
extended as necessary by the `size` (in bytes) plus some additional bytes.
Within the current implementation, an extra 4096 bytes are allocated, but
applications should not rely on this additional buffer space.

The buffer exposed by this function is empty internal storage from the
`OggSyncState` struct, beginning at the fill mark within the struct.

After copying data into this buffer you should call `ogg_sync_wrote` to tell the
`OggSyncState` struct how many bytes were actually written, and update the
fill mark.

Returns an `Array` wrapping the provided buffer and the new `OggSyncState`
value.

The general proceedure is to request a pointer into an internal ogg_sync_state
buffer by calling ogg_sync_buffer(). The buffer is then filled up to the
requested size with new input, and ogg_sync_wrote() is called to advance the
fill pointer by however much data was actually written.

It is up to the caller to make sure that the `syncstate` does not get garbage-
collected before the page data is used or copied. This often requires the use
of `GC.@preserve`.

Caution: This function should be called before reading into the buffer to ensure
that data does not remain in the OggSyncState struct. Failing to do so may
result in a memory leak. See the example code below for details.

Returns a new RawOggPage if it was available, or nothing if not (more data is
